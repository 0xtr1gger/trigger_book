## 802.11 frame format

- 802.11 frames have a different format than 802.3 Ethernet frames.

>[!note] Depending on the 802.11 version and the message type, some of the fields might not be present in the frame.

![[802.11_frame_format.svg]]

- **Frame control**
	- Provides information about the message type and subtype.

- **Duration/ID**
	- Depending on the message type:
		- **Duration:** the time (in microseconds) the channel will be dedicated for transmission of this frame.
		- **ID:** Association ID (AID); identifier for the association (connection).

- **Addresses**
	- **Destination Address (DA):** final recipient of the frame
	- **Source Address (SA):** original sender of the frame
	- **Receiver Address (RA):** immediate recipient of the frame (not necessarily the final destination)
	- **Transmitter Address (TA):** immediate sender of the frame (not necessarily the original sender)

>[!note] Up to 4 addresses can be present in an 802.11 frame. Which addresses are present in which order depends on the message type.

- **Sequence control**
	- Used to reassemble fragments and eliminate duplicate frames.

- **QoS control**
	- Used in QoS to prioritize certain traffic.

- **HT (High Throughput) control**
	- Added in 802.11n to enable High Throughput operations.
	- 802.11n is also known as High Throughput (HT) Wi-Fi
	- 802.11ac is also known as Very High Throughput (VHT) Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 5)

- **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)**
	- Same as in the [[Ethernet_frames|Ethernet frame]], used to check for errors.

## 802.11 frame types

There are three types of 802.11 messages:

- **Management frames:** used to manage the BSS
	- Beacon
	- Probe request, probe response
	- Authentication
	- Association request, association response

- **Control frames:** used to control access to the medium (RF); assist with deliver of management and data frames.
	- RTS (Request to Send)
	- CTS (Clear to Send)
	- ACK

- **Data frames:** used to send actual data packets.
## Association Process

- Access Points bridge traffic between wireless stations and other devices.
- There are three 802.11 connections states:
	- Not authentication, not associated
	- **Authenticated**, not associated
	- **Authenticated** and **associated** 
	
>[!important] For a station to send traffic through the AP, it must be both **authenticated and associated** with that AP. 

>[!important] There are two ways a station can scan for a BSS:
>- **Active scanning:** the station sends probe requests and listens for a probe response from an AP.
>- **Passive scanning:** the station listens for **beacon messages** from an AP. 
>
>**Beacon messages** are sent periodically by APs to advertise the BSS.

>[!important] Association process
>>[!note] State: not authenticated, not associated
> 1. A station sends a **probe request** messages to learn about available APs.
> 2. The AP sends a **probe response** to advertise itself. 
>
>>[!note] State: **authenticated**, not associated
>
> 1. The station sends an **authentication request**, which contains, for example, a password to the AP.
> 2. The AP sends an **authentication response**, and authenticates the station.
> 
>>[!note] State: **authenticated** and **associated**
> 
> 5. The station sends an **association request**.
> 6. The AP sends an **association response**.
