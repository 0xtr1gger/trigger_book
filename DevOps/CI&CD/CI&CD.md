In the current fast-paced software development environment, the ability to deliver high-quality code quickly and efficiently is paramount. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are two essential practices that facilitate this goal by automating the processes of code integration, testing, and deployment; CI/CD is one of the fundamental tenets of the DevOps process, a set of principles designed to deliver applications and services faster than with a traditional software development approach, while maintaining or improving the quality of the products. 

## CI/CD

>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a software development practice that combines Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to automate the integration, testing, and deployment of code changes. 

Alright, let's break this down. 

#### Continuous Integration 

>Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice of frequently committing code changes to a shared repository, and then automatically testing these changes to verify that they can be safely merged into a project.

- The CI approach assumes that developers regularly (often several times a day) commit small, incremental changes to the code. After each commit, automated tests are run to verify that the new code works as expected with the existing project. This helps to identify conflicts and issues during the early development stages.

- Continuous Integration aims to keep the codebase in a working state all the time, making it possible to release the software at any moment.

This contrasts with traditional software development, where programmers would occasionally commit large chunks of code. This would lead to potential conflicts and a more complicated process of fixing errors, as the system would typically be in a non-working state during integration.

- CI facilitates collaboration, since developers working on the project can inspect the changes made to a shared repository and give feedback easily. This leads to a more transparent development process.

- Additionally, CI relies heavily on version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage and track changes in code over time.

- Continuous Integration encourages the practice of regularly pulling changes from the branch into feature branches to minimize any potential issues during merging.

- Once a feature is complete, a developer creates a pull request (PR) or merge request (MR) to propose merging their feature branch back into the main branch. The PR is usually reviewed by team members to provide an opportunity for feedback and discussion before the code is merged.

- When a PR is created, CI tools typically trigger automated tests. If any tests fail, the developer can address the issues before merging.

- Once the PR is approved, the feature branch can be merged into the main branch.
  
#### CD: Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery

>Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development approach that involves producing software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.

- The primary goal of Continuous Delivery is to keep the software in a state that is always ready to be deployed to production. This helps to integrate a proactive approach to software delivery to avoid panic releases or last-minute fixes.

- Continuous Delivery emphasizes comprehensive automated testing, including unit, integration, and acceptance tests to minimizes defects and ensure the code is of high quality during the whole development process. 

- Code changes are typically deployed to a staging environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. In this stage, software can undergo further testing to evaluate behavior and performance. 
- This is one of the key concepts that CD employs: testing and production environments should be identical.

- Although the code is built, tested, and prepared for release automatically, the final step — the deployment to production — is performed manually; the code is reviewed by QA or operational teams before the changes can be released. In this stage, the software can be examined to ensure compliance with business and quality standards. This gives flexibility and control over when to release.

- Continuous Delivery creates a faster feedback loop, which significantly enhances the ability to respond to user needs and correct issues more swiftly.

---

Continuous Deployment takes one step further. With Continuous Deployment, code changes that have passed automated tests are automatically deployed to the production environment without the need for manual approval.

This means that every change that passes automated tests is immediately released into production.

>Continuous Deployment (CD) is a practice to automatically deploying code changes to production after the changes have passed through an automated testing phase. 

- Unlike Continuous Delivery, where a manual step (approval) is typically required before deployment to production, Continuous Deployment automates the entire release process once the code passes all necessary tests. 

- Because changes are deployed as soon as they’re ready, developers receive even more rapid feedback about their changes in real-world conditions. 

- Continuous Deployment builds upon the foundation of Continuous Delivery. Specifically, for Continuous Deployment to be possible, a solid Continuous Delivery pipeline must be in place to automate the testing and ensure the code is always in a deployable state.

- Successful implementation of Continuous Deployment often requires a cultural shift within organizations, promoting trust among teams and embracing the ability to fail fast and recover quickly.

## CI/CD pipelines

>A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated processes that streamline the creation, testing, and deployment of software. 

- A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that enable software development teams to deliver code faster, safer, and more reliably.

CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of automation in the CI/CD process. The main objective is to minimize human error and maintain a consistent workflow for software testing and release.

This automated pipeline may employ different tools, with each responsible for its part of the workflow, such as:
- Compiling and building code
- Running unit, integration, or other types of tests
- Analyzing code quality and security
- Deploying to staging or production-like environments
- For containerized environments, building container images and deploying across cloud or hybrid cloud platforms

Each step of a CI/CD pipeline represents a subset of tasks grouped into coherent  pipeline stages.

Although CI/CD processes vary heavily depending on the technologies used in the project, a typical CI/CD pipeline consists of the following four stages, executed in order:

 - Source code
	 - The development process begins with the code. A pipeline is usually triggered by changes made to a source code repository, e.g., a `git push` or `git merge`.
	 - Pipelines may also be triggered by scheduled events (cron jobs) or the results of other pipelines or processes.

 - Build
	 - The build stage is responsible for building software from the shared repository to a testing environment.
	 - This step is crucial for languages that require compilation, such as Go, Java, or C/C++. However, for interpreted languages like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript, this may involve just packaging the code rather than full compilation.
	 - In containerized environments, regardless of the programming language in use, this stage includes building necessary Docker images (or using other container runtimes) to prepare cloud-native software for deployment.


 - Test
	 - In the testing stage, the code undergoes various automated tests to validate its functionality and identify issues. This includes unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and load tests. 
	 - Code analysis tools may also be utilized to ensure code quality and security standards are met.

 - Deploy
	 - In the deployment phase, the software is released to a staging or production environment, making it available for testers or users.
	 - This stage ensures that the application is correctly deployed and that all configuration settings are accurate for the target environment.

>**Building vs. Compiling**
>
>Compiling refers to the process of translating human-readable source code written in programming languages like C/C++ into low-level machine code (binary). This process is performed by a compiler.
>
>In contrast, building encompasses a broader range of activities involved in preparing software for deployment. Building can include pre-processing, compiling, linking, converting data files, running automated tests, and packaging the software.

## CI/CD tools

There are many CI/CD tools in the industry. Each aims to streamline software development by automating testing and deployment processes, and each has its own unique features that cater to different project requirements, team sizes, and preferred workflows. 

Here are some of the popular CI/CD tools:

- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- TeamCity
- Bamboo
- CircleCI
- ArgoCD

The choice depends on factors like existing infrastructure, team expertise, and specific project needs. 

Jenkins is no doubt one of the most common options thanks to its flexibility, ability to integrate with practically any languages and tools, and an open-source nature.
