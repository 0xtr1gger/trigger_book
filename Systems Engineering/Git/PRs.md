## Pull requests

>A pull request (PR) is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another so teammates can review, discuss, and approve before integrating the work into the main codebase.

- A PR shows the diff between a source branch (feature/topic branch) and a target/base branch (often `main` or `release` branch) so collaborators can review and discuss the changes before merge.


## Roles and states

## Typical PR workflow

## How to puck up a half-finished PR

- Clone the branch and check it locally, run tests, and read the PR description and all review commends to understand what remains. Address one thread at at a time.
- Push commits that resolve each comment; mark threads as resolved if your repo requires it before merge.
- If the PR is draft, convert to `Reavy for review` when you're confident.
- Keep commits focused.
